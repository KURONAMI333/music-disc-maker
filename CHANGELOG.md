# Changelog

## 1.2.1

- Fixed YouTube links with playlist parameters (`&list=...`) failing to load — single-track links are now normalized to the bare video before streaming
- Music Disc Maker, Blank Disc, and disc-to-Blank recipes now appear in the vanilla recipe book once you have the ingredients (recipe unlock advancements added)

## 1.2.0

- Playback range is now configurable (`playbackRange` config option, default 64, range 16-256 blocks) — hear custom discs from farther away
- Fixed audio not resuming after reconnecting or joining late while a custom disc was already playing (jukeboxes are now rescanned on chunk load / relog)

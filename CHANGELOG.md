# Changelog

## 1.2.0

- Playback range is now configurable (`playbackRange` config option, default 64, range 16-256 blocks) — hear custom discs from farther away
- Fixed audio not resuming after reconnecting or joining late while a custom disc was already playing (jukeboxes are now rescanned on chunk load / relog)
